# DIDecentral Community Hub 

**For Creators of Educational Resources related to Decentralized Identity**

* [DIDecentral.com](https://didecentral.com)
* [RWoT Literature Directory](https://didecentral.com/rwot-dir)
* [Decentralized-ID.com](https://decentralized-id.com)

The above resources are co-created by DIDecentral community members and their associates.

## Membership

This is a **DO**-ocracy. By participating in this community, you will be granted associated permissions, in proportion to your level of participation, particularly any permissions that will make it easier for those who are contributing to feel encouraged to do so.

Once a core group of at least 5 active members forms, we can discuss amongst eachother and work out more fine grained rules \ proceedures.

For now, most guides will be HowTos not rules and regulations.

## Community Blog

That's right! This is a perfect space for a community blog, where anyone can contribute. This site can even offer a gentle segue from interacting soley via browser tab, to a more nuanced experience of these resources. It could even be a hobby whereby you turn your passion for decentralized identity into web-work skills (I heard those are in demand).


## Thanks for Stopping By!

Will have more here soon
