Since then, the IIW has met bi-anually, actively supporting the development of the identity software-ecosystem, including [OpenID](http://wiki.openid.net)('05), OpenID [2.0](http://wiki.openid.net/w/page/12995215/OpenID%20Authentication%202-1)('06), [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth)('10), [FIDO](https://fidoalliance.org/)('13) and OpenID [Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)('14). 

... 

<blockquote>
IIW is at its heart a participatory conference. Through dozens of sessions, lunches, and two evening meals (all included in ticket) you’ll have plenty of chances to exchange ideas and make new professional connections.

This is the time and place that you get to discuss, share your knowledge, work on and learn about anything & everything related to Internet Identity today.

Spring: April 30, 2019 – May 2, 2019

Fall: October 01, 2019 – October 03, 2019

## Rebooting Web of Trust

* [White Papers, Specifications & Proofs of Concept](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/white-papers--specifications---and-proof-of-concept-code.md) 
  >Our goal for this initial #RebootingWebOfTrust design workshop is to:
  >
  > * Focus on the creation of the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems.
  > * To generate 5 technical white papers on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future"
  >
  > To this end, I thought it would be useful to define what is a white paper, and as some people desire to go beyond this, what is a specification and proof of concept code.
