## XDI

* [**XDI**](xdi.html) **>>**

The XNS Public Trust Organization was founded in July 2000, shortly after International Planetwork Conference. -[xdi.org - History](http://xdi.org/?page_id=13)
  > to promote the concept of individuals owning their own digital identity and data based on a nascent technology being produced by two Technical Committees at OASIS: XRI (Extensible Resource Identifier) and XDI (Extensible Data Interchange).
* [tutorial.xdi2.org](https://tutorial.xdi2.org)
  > XDI is a technology for modeling, storing, and manipulating data.
  >
  > It fits into a similar category of technologies as JSON, XML and RDF, but also has a number of properties that distinguishes it.
  >
  > XDI is a graph-based data model. This means that all data is expressed using nodes and arcs in a graph. At a minimum, a graph consists of a single node, called the common root node.

### DID the Decentralized Identifier

* [DID Whitepaper](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot2-id2020/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/DID-Whitepaper.md)
  > A DID architecture should focus on the set of components that Mr. Gupta refers to as "the minimum required for people to be able to do business (or other critical functions) together".
  >
  >**A Decentralized Identifier (DID) Registry and Discovery Service**
  >
  > This "minimum required" is defined by a union of the proposed requirements identified by the W3C Credential Community Group, the XDI.org Registry Working Group, and the Rebooting the Web of Trust group. It consists of three functions that can be addressed by a combination of blockchain and DHT technology:
  >
  > * A DID registration function
  > * A discovery function that enables looking up a registered DID in the blockchain
  > * A master key recovery function

## Ethereum ERC-EIP

* [ERC: Lightweight Identity #1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056) —This ERC describes a standard for creating and updating identities with a limited use of blockchain resources. An identity can have an unlimited number of delegates and attributes associated with it. Identity creation is as simple as creating a regular key pair ethereum account, which means that it's fee (no gas costs) and all ethereum accounts are valid identities. Furthermore this ERC is fully DID compliant.
* [ERC1056 ❤ ERC780 — an open identity and claims protocol for Ethereum](https://medium.com/uport/erc1056-erc780-an-open-identity-and-claims-protocol-for-ethereum-aef7207bc744)
* [EIP-780 Ethereum Claims Registry](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780)
* [EIP712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/f29527ab39357548b06b29e937a48f06ae099de7/EIPS/eip-712.md) - This is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data
* [ERC-1484 Digital Identity Aggregator](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1495) —A protocol for aggregating digital identity information that's broadly interoperable with existing, proposed, and hypothetical future digital identity standards.
* [EIP-1078](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/ed621645c8f3bc5756492f327cda015f35d9f8da/EIPS/eip-1078.md) - 
This presents a method to replace the usual signup/login design pattern with a minimal ethereum native scheme, that doesn’t require passwords, backing up private keys nor typing seed phrases. 
* [ERC-1077 and ERC-1078: The magic of executable signed messages](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-1077-and-erc-1078-the-magic-of-executable-signed-messages-to-login-and-do-actions/351)

### ERC725-735 

* [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) 
  * The following describes standard functions for a unique identifiable proxy account to be used by humans, groups, organisations, objects and machines
* [ERC735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735) -  The following describes standard functions for adding, removing and holding of claims.
  - These claims can attested from third parties (issuers) or self attested.

## Blockcerts 
* [Learning Machine](https://www.learningmachine.com/)
* [Academic Credentialing and the Blockchain](https://www.learningmachine.com/academic-credentialing-blockchain/)
* [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org), developed by learning machine is an open standard for issuing and verifying blockchain-based official records; The project offers  open-source libraries, tools, and mobile apps. MIT has [issued](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/10/19/mit-introduces-digital-diplomas) digital certificates based on this standard.

## Schema
* [Schema](https://schema.org) — a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet. Schema.org vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. These vocabularies cover entities, relationships between entities and actions, and can easily be extended through a well-documented extension model. Over 10 million sites use Schema.org to markup their web pages and email messages. Many applications from Google, Microsoft, Pinterest, Yandex and others already use these vocabularies to power rich, extensible experiences."
