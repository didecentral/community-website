# Ethereum Identity 
**Specifications, Literature, (d)Apps, and GitHub Repositories**

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/XWeGM72.png)
* [Decentralized Digital Identity on Ethereum](https://www.slideshare.net/FabriceCroiseaux/ethcc-2018-decentralized-digital-identity-on-ethereum) -SlideShare
* [DEVCON1: Digital Identity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpaTOvAhLR4) — video from DEVCON1
* [Proof-of-Individuality](http://proofofindividuality.online/) — how to prove a person only has one account
   * [Anti-Sybil Protocol using virtual pseudonym parties](https://medium.com/@unlisted/anti-sybil-protocol-using-virtual-pseudonym-parties-10276fcf3b20)

## ERC-EIP

* [ERC: Lightweight Identity #1056](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1056) —This ERC describes a standard for creating and updating identities with a limited use of blockchain resources. An identity can have an unlimited number of delegates and attributes associated with it. Identity creation is as simple as creating a regular key pair ethereum account, which means that it's fee (no gas costs) and all ethereum accounts are valid identities. Furthermore this ERC is fully DID compliant.
* [ERC1056 ❤ ERC780 — an open identity and claims protocol for Ethereum](https://medium.com/uport/erc1056-erc780-an-open-identity-and-claims-protocol-for-ethereum-aef7207bc744)
* [EIP-780 Ethereum Claims Registry](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/780)
* [EIP712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/f29527ab39357548b06b29e937a48f06ae099de7/EIPS/eip-712.md) - This is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data
* [ERC-1484 Digital Identity Aggregator](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1495) —A protocol for aggregating digital identity information that's broadly interoperable with existing, proposed, and hypothetical future digital identity standards.
* [EIP-1078](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/ed621645c8f3bc5756492f327cda015f35d9f8da/EIPS/eip-1078.md) - 
This presents a method to replace the usual signup/login design pattern with a minimal ethereum native scheme, that doesn’t require passwords, backing up private keys nor typing seed phrases. 
* [ERC-1077 and ERC-1078: The magic of executable signed messages](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-1077-and-erc-1078-the-magic-of-executable-signed-messages-to-login-and-do-actions/351)

* [ERC725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) 
  * The following describes standard functions for a unique identifiable proxy account to be used by humans, groups, organisations, objects and machines

  - These claims can attested from third parties (issuers) or self attested.
