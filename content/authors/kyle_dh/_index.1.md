Kyle Den Hartog wants to see a world where passwords are eliminated as the primary form of authentication. This vision led him to be an eager contributor to the design and development of DID-Auth along with other standards in the decentralized identity community. Loaded with a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science from the University of Iowa, a penchant for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, and a need to enhance human cultures everywhere with self-sovereign identity systems, Den Hartog launches himself headfirst into active like-minded communities that embrace these topics.

When Den Hartog isnâ€™t designing standards for breakfast, eating code for lunch, and evangelizing self-sovereign identity for dinner, he enjoys skiing, bicycling, and traveling. So far, Den Hartog claims his favorite place he visited was Tanzania where he particular enjoyed Mafia Island.
