<!--this comment is for demonstration purposes https://didecentral.com/contributors-quickstart/ -->

If you're wondering why DIDecentral now has it's own community site, separate from [Decentralized-id.com](https://decentralized-id.com), you're in the right place.

This website will be the home base for information on all of the projects we're involved with, the ways that you can get involved. and (as usual) where to find more information.

## DIDecentral - Community Website

![](https://imgur.com/mWR3qCf.png)

This website will be the home base for anyone interested in *active participation* with this assortment of public-domain informational resources. 

Here will live the guides for *everything* in the DIDecentral universe, in addition to any specific guides you will find on our other web-sites (as they are not all set up exactly the same).

Over time, there will also be an increasing variety of starting points, and ways to connect with us and the work we're doing.

### Contributors Guides

The first two guides should be plenty ot get you started learning about how things work around here. There aren't rules or established ways of doing anything, as much as "this is how it's currently done."

* [Intro](https://didecentral.com/contributors-guide/intro/) - The easiest ways to participate with DIDecentral.
* [Quickstart](https://didecentral.com/contributors-guide/quickstart/) - 
  * [Infobot Hello](https://didecentral.com/test/infobot-hello/) - Teplate for your first community blogpost.
* [Site Setup and Configuration](https://didecentral.com/contributors-guide/site-config/) - 'Everything' about how this site is configured. 
* [Social Curation Archive](https://didecentral.com/contributors-guide/discord-archive-howto/) - How to export discord history and integrate with Minimal Mistakes Jekyll.


### Discord Archive

![](https://imgur.com/6kSmrVQ.png)

After seeing how nice it was to use discord exports to archive the [SourceCrypto](https://sourcecrypto.pub) Discord server, which has 170+ channels of information organized by topic, it was easy to imagine what could be done for the Decentralized ID resources.

Partly, it's not possible to always keep websites up to date. However, when saving links in the channels of a discord server, it's much easier to publish periodic updates of those archives, than it is to keep every individual page of a web-site current with all of the resources we have at hand.

A small core of contributors is beginning to develop, and it will be simple to build, organize, and grow the body of knowledge we have available.

All of the content from Decentralized-id.com and from the ID channels of SourceCrypto has been arranged in the discord server, according to a system that is under development, and will evolve as channels and categories are created to serve specific types of content.

## Rebooting Web of Trust - Archive

![](https://didecentral.com/rwot-dir/assets/images/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-header-pages.jpeg)

This project began from some spirited email threads, discussion in chat, and a few false starts. The idea is that the repositories of each RWoT workshop is full of valuable content that could be made more accessible to the research community that has collectively contributed it, along with others who are trying to catch up.

* [didecentral.com/rwot-dir](https://didecentral.com/rwot-dir/)

At the moment, the first workshop is more or less completely set-up, and the rest is mostly a work in progress. Once complete, it is likely to be integrated with [weboftrust.info](https://www.weboftrust.info/) in some fashion. However, this is only a demonstration of the simplest deployment of such a resource. Down the line, other iterations may take precedence, perhaps, building from and extending this one.

The ultimate goal is to be able to filter by author, tag, category, have integrated annotations, and combining data from different sources to generate interactive visual experiences around the collective bodies of literature.

## IDCommons - Identity History Timeline

![](https://imgur.com/0sAr1Wn.png)

We are working to decide how to organize an ever increasing volume and variety of information. It seems good to merge all of the ID-History content from Decentralized-id.com, and combine it with the ongoing efforts of IDCommons. 

This solution offers increased modularity, and distribution of responsibility for caretaking this wealth of knowledge.

## Decentralized-id.com

[![](https://decentralized-id.com/images/identity-decentralized.png)](https://decentralized-id.com)

Here we'll try to keep track of all the essential organizations, related codebases, specs and regulations. There are a variety of challenges to be faced in this task:

**Challenges**

1. This market can move very quickly, as we've discovered over the past few months.
  * This is a good reason to track links in the channels of discord and on twitter via #hashtag and @mentions. This way, content may be syndicated, here, to our community site, more quickly than the resources we are building can be updated.
2. Those who have the time and availability, are the least likely to be qualified, so the resources may grow only as quickly as our proficiencies develop.
3. It's sometimes necessary to find paying work, so focus is always diverted between potential opportunities even if we'd rather be working to create the best DID content, ever.

* [Decentralized-id.com](https://decentralized-id.com)

## Community

As a community grows, the need for fine grained codes of conduct grows also. However, some of the best communities online with the best community guidelines are classically bad at living up to their own standards.

Its not entirely certain that "community" scales. I'll share these two links as food for thought.

* [Run your own social](https://runyourown.social/) - How to run a small social network site for your friends.

* [The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet – OneZero](https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1) - Why the dark forests of the internet — podcasts, newsletters, and other private channels — are growing, and why might that pose a problem

[![](https://imgur.com/53XxT59.png)](https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1)


**These capture two sides of the same issue**:

1. Community seems to work better in small groups between 50-100 people.
2. If we flee "popular" platforms for social expression, the type of culture we're seeking to avoid is given ground to flourish.

Fortunately github accounts, organizations, and web-hosting are all free, and forking is built right into it. So it's a lot simpler to reclaim a project that's gone astray (or even split into equally valid factions) than irl where physical resources and space are limited.

Rather than trying to scale DIDecentral, it may be best, once it grows to a certain point to simply divide the content and our efforts into different sites, focusing on different aspects of ID, allowing each recieve a deeper treatment in it's own space.

Ideally, the resources created via DIDecentral will be replicated and iterated upon endlessly. Our favorite solutions involve direct action. If there's something you see that could be better, feel free to leave a comment, send a pull-request, or fork the project (and we hope to make all those options as frictionless as possible).

Within or without this organization, the doers have final say. A correlary to that concept is that the best suggestions come with a demo.

Perhaps with deeper thought, additional study, and time we'll tell how these matters should be arranged.
