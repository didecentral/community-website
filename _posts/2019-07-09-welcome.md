This website will be the home base for anyone interested in *active participation* with this assortment of public-domain informational resources. 

Here will live the guides for *everything* in the our communities universe.

Over time, there will also be an increasing variety of starting points, and ways to connect with us and the work we're doing.


### Discord Archive

After seeing how nice it was to use discord exports to archive the [SourceCrypto](https://sourcecrypto.pub) Discord server, which had 170+ channels of information organized by topic, it was easy to imagine what could be done for the Decentralized ID resources.

Partly, it's not possible to always keep websites up to date. However, when saving links in the channels of a discord server, it's much easier to publish periodic updates of those archives, than it is to keep every individual page of a web-site current with all of the resources we have at hand.


## Community

**These capture two sides of the same issue**:

1. Community seems to work better in small groups between 50-100 people.
2. If we flee "popular" platforms for social expression, the type of culture we're seeking to avoid is given ground to flourish.

Fortunately github accounts, organizations, and web-hosting are all free, and forking is built right into it. So it's a lot simpler to reclaim a project that's gone astray (or even split into equally valid factions) than irl where physical resources and space are limited.

Rather than trying to scale, it may be best, once it grows to a certain point to simply divide the content and our efforts into different sites, focusing on different aspects of ID, allowing each receive a deeper treatment in it's own space.

Ideally, the resources created here will be replicated and iterated upon endlessly. Our favorite solutions involve direct action. If there's something you see that could be better, feel free to leave a comment, send a pull-request, or fork the project (and we hope to make all those options as frictionless as possible).

Within or without this organization, the doers have final say. A corollary to that concept is that the best suggestions come with a demo.

Perhaps with deeper thought, additional study, and time we'll tell how these matters should be arranged.
