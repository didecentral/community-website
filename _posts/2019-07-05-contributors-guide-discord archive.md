This is another guide, while I'm doing it, may as well record all of the steps, so others can re-produce.

I made a considerable effort to copy all of the links that are on the Decentralized-id.com website into our new [discord server](https://discord.gg/eYm2XvZ). The idea is the replicate what I already did for a much broader subject, in [SourceCrypto](https://sourcecrypto.pub).

So now, lets see about publishing this archive.
