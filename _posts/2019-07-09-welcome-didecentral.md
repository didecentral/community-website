## Welcome!

You may find yourself scratching your head, and wondering why DIDecentral has it's own community site, separate from [Decentralized-id.com](https://decentralized-id.com). 

This article will go over the various projects associated with @DIDecentral, and point out where to find more information.

## DIDecentral - Community Website

![](https://imgur.com/mWR3qCf.png)

This website will be the home base for anyone interested in participating with this assortment of public-domain informational resources. Here will live the guides for *everything* in the DIDecentral universe, in addition to any specific guides you will find on our other web-sites (as they are not all set up exactly the same).

## Contributors Guides

These two guides should be plenty ot get you started learning about how things work around here. There aren't rules or established ways of doing anything, as much as "this is how it's currently done."

* [DIDecentral: Contributors Intro](/contributors-intro/)
* [Minimal-Mistakes - Configuration](/website-configuration/)

As a community grows, the need for fine grained codes of conduct grows also. However, some of the best communities online with the best community guidelines are classically bad at living up to their own standards.

Its not entirely certain that "community" scales. 

* [Run your own social](https://runyourown.social/) - How to run a small social network site for your friends.
* [The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet – OneZero](https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1) - Why the dark forests of the internet — podcasts, newsletters, and other private channels — are growing, and why might that pose a problem

These documents capture two opposing sides of the same issue.

1. Community works better in small groups between 50-100 people.
2. If we flee "popular" platforms for social expression, the exact culture we're seeking to avoid is able to grow stronger.

"I've seen a lot of human attempts at decentralized, consensus-based, governance. Centralization works much more consistently." -@infominer33

The most successful communities tend to have some type of benevolant dictator, who generally avoids intervening in the affairs of others under their care. These individuals tend to be leaders because of resources they are able to share with others for the purpose of creating community, and likely also because they are passionately working towards an end that is easy for others to rally around.

We want decentralization, but we underestimate how ineffective it can actually be. Decentralization is not a pursuit for those with a low time-preference.

Ideally, the resources created via DIDecentral will be replicated and iterated upon innumerably. My favorite solutions involve direct action. If there's something you don't like or think you could do better, feel free to contact us, send a pull-request, or fork the project (and we hope to make all those options as frictionless as possible).

Within or without this organization, the doers have final say. (read: the best suggestions come with a demo).

## Discord Archive

After seeing how nice it was to use discord exports to archive the [SourceCrypto](https://sourcecrypto.pub) Discord server, which has 170+ channels of information organized by topic, it was easy to imagine what could be done for the Decentralized ID resources.

Partly, it's not possible to always websites up to date. However, when saving links in the channels of a discord server, it's much easier to publish periodic updates of those archives, than it is to keep every individual page of a web-site current with all of the resources we have at hand.

A small core of contributors is beginning to develop, and it will be simple to build, organize, and grow the body of knowledge we have available.

All of the content from Decentralized-id.com and from the ID channels of SourceCrypto has been arranged in the discord server, according to a system that is under development, and will evolve as channels and categories are created to serve specific types of information.

## Rebooting Web of Trust - Archive

![](https://didecentral.com/rwot-dir/assets/images/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-header-pages.jpeg)

This project began from some spirited email threads, discussion in chat, and a few false starts. The idea is that the repositories of each RWoT workshop is full of valuable content, that could be made more accessible to the research community that has collectively contributed that content, along with others who may be new to decentralized identity and the related technologoes.

* [didecentral.com/rwot-dir](https://didecentral.com/rwot-dir/)

At the moment, the first workshop is more or less completely set-up, and the rest is mostly a work in progress. Once complete, it is likely to be integrated with [weboftrust.info](https://www.weboftrust.info/) in some fashion. However, this is simply a demonstration of the simplest deployment of such a resource. Down the line, other iterations may take precedence, perhaps, building from and extending this one.

The ultimate goal is to be able to filter by author, tag, and keyword, have integrated annotations, and generate interactive visual experiences with our collective bodies of literature.

## IDCommons - Identity History Timeline

![](https://imgur.com/0sAr1Wn.png)

We are working to figure out how to organize an ever increasing volume and variety of information. It seems good to merge all of the ID-History content from Decentralized-id.com, and combine it with the ongoing efforts of IDCommons. 

This solution offers increased modularity, and distribution of responsibility for caretaking this wealth of knowledge.

## Decentralized-id.com

Here we'll try to keep track of all the essential organizations, related codebases, specs and regulations. There are a variety of challenges to be faced in this task:

**Challenges**

1. This market can move very quickly, as we've discovered over the past few months.
  * This is a good reason to track links in the channels of discord and on twitter via #hashtag and @mentions. This way, content may be syndicated, here, to our community site, more quickly than the resources we are building can be updated.
2. Those who have the time and availability, are the least likely to be qualified, so the resources may grow only as quickly as our skill-sets and incentives align.
3. It's sometimes necessary to find paying work, so focus is always diverted among potential opportunities, these sites developed as time is made available.

## Be Back Soon


This is a published draft. There will be a twitter post when its closer to complete.
