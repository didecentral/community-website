We are happy for contributions from anyone, regardless of technical skills, or pre-existing knowledge. The intention is also to enable anyone to become more familiar with web-publishing, in a low stakes environment, while pursuing a passion for Sovereign Identity.

## On GitHub
I welcome any issues or pull requests for question, comments, or contributions of any type.

### DIDecentral - Repositories

A number of repositories which will be good sources for content creation have been forked into this organization for reference. The following are the primary repositories under our care.

* [DIDecentral](https://github.com/DIDecentral)
  * [didecentral/decentralized-id.com](https://github.com/didecentral/decentralized-id.com)
  * [didecentral/didecentral.github.io](https://github.com/didecentral/didecentral.github.io)
  * [didecentral/rwot-dir](https://github.com/didecentral/rwot-dir)
  * [Identitywoman/identity-commons](https://github.com/Identitywoman/identity-commons) - It would be nice to help with this, also.

Besides these, there are a couple other copies of the RWoT Directory project published through different site generators.

## GitHub Issues

* [didecentral/didecentral.github.io/issues](https://github.com/didecentral/didecentral.github.io/issues)
* [didecentral/decentralized-id.com/issues](https://github.com/didecentral/decentralized-id.com/issues)
* [didecentral/rwot-dir/issues](https://github.com/didecentral/rwot-dir/issues)

Generally speaking, this is a good place if you have a link or two to contribute, a question, or would like to complain about some broken feature of the website.

## Pull-Requests

* [didecentral/didecentral.github.io/pulls](https://github.com/didecentral/didecentral.github.io/pulls)
* [didecentral/decentralized-id.com/pulls](https://github.com/didecentral/decentralized-id.com/pulls)
* [didecentral/rwot-dir/pulls](https://github.com/didecentral/rwot-dir/pulls)


These are good if you'd like to correct something, or suggest some changes to any aspect of the site. Also, a pull-request is the official pipeline for introducing changes to a repository.

Over time we will introduce more fine grained guides on how to do this in a way so that your contribution is easily accepted and recorded in the git history.

### "Edit This Page" 

![](https://imgur.com/t0Si4aE.png)

Nearly every page, on each of the sites I operate has a section like this, where you can share or edit on GitHub.

Clicking that button takes you to the raw, unformatted version of the page on GitHub. When you are logged in to GitHub, that puts you one click away from editing this page: look for the pencil icon on the right side, just above where the line-numbered raw file begins.

Clicking it will reload an take you to an editable version of the page, which proposes an update through github.  The monitor icon will open an editable change-proposal of the file.  This allows you to contribute through a familiar interface (your web-browser), without having to understand anything about GitHub.

Whether it's an actual improvement, fully functioning with proper markup, or simply a note intended for me to read, but not include on the page, it will be read and appreciated! Even if your change isn't perfect: I'll try to accept it and include your "commits", which are github's way of recording your contribution. I'm not a "GitHub professional", but I take this seriously and work on these pages this day in and day out.

## If you all could just..

![](https://infominer.id/bookmark-donations/that-would-be-great.jpg)

If you would export me a copy of your bookmarks.... that would be great! After a while I'll make a few fine grained how-to. This is one of the simplest ways that nearly anyone could make a significant contribution. I want to create detailed guides, to ensure that everyone is able.

## @ mention on twitter

You can simply @ mention @didecentral, @sourcecrypto @LCT-curator and any other accounts we've created for a particular niche, on twitter. Soon, each organization within the InfoHub will have it's own Twitter account, and the history of each of those accounts will be preserved and republished on their respective websites in keeping with [indieweb](https://web-work.tools/indieweb/) principles.

## Contributing Via Discord

Discord is, hands down, my favorite way to collaborate with contributors informally. If you've never used it before, Discord is a powerful, free-to-use, closed-source communication/collaboration platform like Slack or Telegram, originally designed for the gaming community but since popular with opensource projects and startups. 

You can see if you read around in the snapshot I recently published here of the contents of the [SourceCrypto Discord Server](https://SourceCrypto.pub/discolog/) that I use Discord as a kind of open and social blotter for ideas, links, and resources. 

![](https://imgur.com/zfLWXVSl.png){: .align-left}
Throughout the day, I share posts to the channels of various discord servers I operate, throughout my day, on the fly ... mostly on smoke breaks. 

A number of others have contributed over the past year, and now it is starting to pick up steam. Its also possible to leave comments, and questions inline with the links. Any that have substance, and are on-topic, will be re-published in the eventual discord export to web-page.

I'll by adding more details to this page, like tips and tricks for each mode of contribution, in the coming weeks.

### Discord Mobile Share 

I have an iPhone, and will have to discover how to do this with Android. However, I hope it's rather intuitive, once you think of it. 

Here I'm visiting [Dev.to](https://dev.to) on my smoke break, and find some useful content, almost always.

I had to enable sharing to discord, and you might have to do the same type of thing with android. Once you've set up the sharing integration, then it's simple to do, on the go.
