We are happy for contributions from anyone, regardless of technical skills, or pre-existing knowledge. The intention for this website is also to enable anyone to become more familiar with web-publishing, in a low stakes environment, while pursuing a passion for Sovereign Identity.

## GitHub is Designed for Collaboration

We welcome issues or pull requests for question, comments, or contributions of every type. While some may feel intimidated to get started with GitHub, we assure you it's just like any other social platform with user profiles, content, forms and buttons.

If you have questions, other people probably want to know the answer also.

### DIDecentral - Repositories

A number of repositories which will be good sources for content creation have been forked into this organization for reference. The following are the primary repositories under our care.

* [DIDecentral](https://github.com/DIDecentral)
  * [didecentral/decentralized-id.com](https://github.com/didecentral/decentralized-id.com)
  * [didecentral/didecentral.github.io](https://github.com/didecentral/didecentral.github.io)
  * [didecentral/rwot-dir](https://github.com/didecentral/rwot-dir)
  * [Identitywoman/identity-commons](https://github.com/Identitywoman/identity-commons) - It would be nice to help with this, also.

Besides these, there are a couple other copies of the RWoT Directory project published through different site generators.

## GitHub Issues

* [didecentral/didecentral.github.io/issues](https://github.com/didecentral/didecentral.github.io/issues)
* [didecentral/decentralized-id.com/issues](https://github.com/didecentral/decentralized-id.com/issues)
* [didecentral/rwot-dir/issues](https://github.com/didecentral/rwot-dir/issues)

Generally speaking, this is a good place if you have a link or two to contribute, a question, or would like to complain about some broken feature of the website.

## Pull-Requests

* [didecentral/didecentral.github.io/pulls](https://github.com/didecentral/didecentral.github.io/pulls)
* [didecentral/decentralized-id.com/pulls](https://github.com/didecentral/decentralized-id.com/pulls)
* [didecentral/rwot-dir/pulls](https://github.com/didecentral/rwot-dir/pulls)


These are good if you'd like to correct something, or suggest some changes to any aspect of the site. Also, a pull-request is the official pipeline for introducing changes to a repository.

Over time we will introduce more fine grained guides on how to do this in a way so that your contribution is easily accepted and recorded in the git history.

### "Edit This Page" 

![](https://imgur.com/Fv7L2yC.png)

Nearly every page has a section like this, where you can share socially, or edit\view on GitHub.

Clicking that button takes you to the unformatted version of the page on GitHub. When you are logged in to GitHub, that puts you one click away from editing this page: look for the pencil icon on the right side, just above where the line-numbered raw file begins.

Clicking it will reload an take you to an editable version of the page, which proposes an update through github.  The monitor icon will open an editable change-proposal of the file.  This allows you to contribute through a familiar interface (your web-browser), without having to understand anything about GitHub.

Whether it's an actual improvement, fully functioning with proper markup, or simply a note intended for me to read, but not include on the page, it will be read and appreciated! Even if your change isn't perfect: I'll try to accept it and include your "commits", which are github's way of recording your contribution. I'm not a "GitHub professional", but I take this seriously and work on these pages this day in and day out.

## If you all could just..

![](https://infominer.id/bookmark-donations/that-would-be-great.jpg)

If you would export me a copy of your bookmarks.... that would be great! After a while I'll make a few fine grained how-to. This is one of the simplest ways that nearly anyone could make a significant contribution. I will create detailed guides, to ensure that everyone is able.

## Twitter @ Mention and Hash Tags

You can simply @ mention @didecentral, and it's activity will be preserved, soon to by syndicated here on this website, via [indieweb](https://web-work.tools/indieweb/) design. I will also follow related hash-tags and see about re-publishing them here, somehow. 

I will track #decentralizedidentity, #selfsovereignidentity, and #didecentral. The final one is similar to @mention, that you definitely want us to see, but not as "urgent" as the mention.


## Contributing Via Discord

Discord is, hands down, my favorite way to organize information on the fly. It's also quite useful for collaboration. 

If you've never used it before, Discord is a powerful, free-to-use, closed-source communication/collaboration platform like Slack or Telegram, originally designed for the gaming community but since popular with opensource projects and startups.

There are a couple simple ways of sharing to discord that have made it quite convenient for keeping track of information.

Its also possible to leave comments, and questions inline with the links. Any that have substance, and are on-topic, will be re-published in the periodic export of discord to this web-site.

### Discord Desktop

Desktop is much nicer than Moble, for my purposes. Once opened to the Discord App, hit `ctrl + k` and begin typing the name of the channel where you'd like to go.

Even if you don't remember the channel name, it's usually simple enough, even dropping it in the #library-submissions or #general will suffice on the fly, and later the link can be dropped in its appropirate channel.

### Discord Mobile Share 

I have an iPhone, and will have to discover how to do this with Android. However, I hope it's rather intuitive, once you think of it. 

I had to enable sharing to discord, and you might have to do the same type of thing with android. Once you've set up the sharing integration, then it's simple to do, on the go.
