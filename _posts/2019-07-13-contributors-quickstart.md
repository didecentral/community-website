So far, we've covered quite a lot of ground in our contributors guides!

* [Welcome DIDecentral](/welcome/) - A high level overview of the projects we're working on.
* [Contributors Intro](/contributors-intro/) - The easiest ways to participate with DIDecentral.
* [Website Configuration](/website-configuration/) - 'Everything' about how this site is configured.
* [Discord Archive HowTo](/discord-archive-howto/) - How to export discord history and integrate with Minimal Mistakes Jekyll.

What is needed is a quickstart guide, so that you don't need to worry about reading all of that just add and revise content on our web-sites.

In order to contribute directly to these web-sites, you must have a GitHub account. If you don't already have one, head over to [join@github](https://github.com/join) and sign up now :D
